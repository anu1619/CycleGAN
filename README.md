# CycleGAN
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for style transfer between T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By converting T1 images to T2 counterparts, we enhance diagnostic capabilities, reduce multiple imaging sessions, and improve visualization of medical conditions.

# T1 to T2 Style Transfer Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the implementation of a style transfer model that transforms images or text from one style (T1) to another (T2) using TensorFlow. The core idea is to leverage deep learning techniques to capture the style of one image or text and apply it to the content of another, thereby creating a new, stylistically transformed output.

## Installation
Before running the `T1_to_T2_style_transfer.ipynb` notebook, ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed on your system. Additionally, the project requires TensorFlow and TensorFlow Docs for documentation and examples. Install them using the following command:
