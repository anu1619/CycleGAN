# CycleGAN
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for style transfer between T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By converting T1 images to T2 counterparts, we enhance diagnostic capabilities, reduce multiple imaging sessions, and improve visualization of medical conditions.
